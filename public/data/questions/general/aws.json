      "answer": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides on-demand computing resources and services over the internet. AWS offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.\n\nThe main advantages of AWS over traditional on-premises infrastructure include:\n\n**Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-use pricing model eliminates upfront capital expenses for hardware. You only pay for the resources you consume, and can scale costs with your actual usage.\n\n**Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand. Auto Scaling groups can automatically adjust capacity, and services like Lambda provide serverless scaling.\n\n**Global Reach**: AWS has data centers in multiple regions worldwide, enabling global deployment with low latency and compliance with local data residency requirements.\n\n**Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance. Services are designed for 99.99% availability with automated backups and disaster recovery options.\n\n**Security**: Enterprise-grade security with encryption, identity management, and compliance certifications (SOC, ISO, PCI DSS). AWS handles infrastructure security while you manage application-level security.\n\n**Innovation Speed**: Access to cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML services, serverless computing, and IoT without significant upfront investment or expertise requirements.\n\n**Managed Services**: AWS handles infrastructure maintenance, patching, and updates, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.",

      "answer": "AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that enables secure control of access to AWS services and resources. IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and their permissions to AWS resources.\n\n**Core IAM Components**:\n\n**Users**: Individual people or services that need access to AWS resources. Each user has unique security credentials and can be assigned permissions directly or through group membership.\n\n**Groups**: Collections of users that share similar access requirements. Permissions assigned to a group apply to all users in that group, simplifying permission management.\n\n**Roles**: AWS identities with specific permissions that can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services. Roles don't have permanent credentials and are ideal for temporary access.\n\n**Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions. Policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources and under what conditions.\n\n**Policy Types**:\n- **Identity-based policies**: Attached to users, groups, or roles\n- **Resource-based policies**: Attached to resources like S3 buckets\n- **AWS managed policies**: Pre-built policies maintained by AWS\n- **Customer managed policies**: Custom policies created by customers\n- **Inline policies**: Policies directly embedded in a single user, group, or role\n\n**IAM Best Practices**:\n\n**Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions required for users to perform their job functions.\n\n**Use Groups and Roles**: Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users. Use roles for applications and cross-account access.\n\n**Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations and privileged users.\n\n**Regular Access Review**: Periodically review and remove unnecessary permissions and unused credentials.\n\n**Use Policy Conditions**: Implement conditional logic in policies based on IP address, time of day, or MFA status for enhanced security.\n\n**Rotate Credentials**: Regularly rotate access keys and use temporary credentials when possible.",

      "answer": "Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.\n\n**How CloudFront Works**:\n\nCloudFront uses a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches to cache content closer to users. When a user requests content, CloudFront routes the request to the edge location with the lowest latency. If the content is cached, it's delivered immediately. If not, CloudFront retrieves it from the origin server and caches it for future requests.\n\n**Performance Improvements**:\n\n**Reduced Latency**: Content is served from edge locations closest to users, significantly reducing the time it takes to load pages and download files.\n\n**Improved Throughput**: CloudFront's global network infrastructure provides high bandwidth and optimized routing paths, improving data transfer speeds.\n\n**Origin Load Reduction**: By caching content at edge locations, CloudFront reduces the load on origin servers, improving their performance and availability.\n\n**Connection Optimization**: CloudFront maintains persistent connections to origin servers and uses optimization techniques like compression and HTTP/2 support.\n\n**Key Features**:\n\n**Dynamic Content Acceleration**: Even non-cacheable content benefits from CloudFront's optimized network paths and connection pooling.\n\n**Security Integration**: Built-in DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for enhanced security.\n\n**Real-time Metrics**: Detailed analytics and monitoring through CloudWatch integration, providing insights into traffic patterns and performance.\n\n**Customization**: Lambda@Edge allows you to run custom code at edge locations for personalization and advanced routing logic.\n\n**Cost Optimization**: Reduces bandwidth costs by serving content from edge locations and provides various pricing classes to optimize costs based on geographic requirements.\n\n**Use Cases**: Static website hosting, video streaming, API acceleration, software distribution, and mobile application acceleration.",

Returns multiple IP addresses in random order if multiple resources are specified.\n\n**Weighted Routing**: Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights. Useful for A/B testing and gradual deployment rollouts. Example: 70% traffic to new version, 30% to old version.\n\n**Latency-Based Routing**: Routes traffic to the resource in the AWS region that provides the lowest latency for the user. Route 53 measures latency from users to AWS regions.\n\n**Failover Routing**: Configures active-passive failover where traffic is routed to a primary resource when healthy, and to a secondary resource when the primary fails health checks.\n\n**Geolocation Routing**: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of users. You can specify routing by continent, country, or state/province.\n\n**Geoproximity Routing**: Routes traffic based on geographic location of users and resources, with the ability to shift traffic using bias values.\n\n**Multivalue Answer Routing**: Returns multiple healthy IP addresses in response to DNS queries, providing basic load balancing functionality.\n\n**Health Checks**: Route 53 health checks monitor endpoints every 30 seconds and can trigger actions like SNS notifications or DNS failover when endpoints become unhealthy.\n\n**Integration Benefits**: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like ELB, CloudFront, and S3, providing a complete traffic management solution.",
